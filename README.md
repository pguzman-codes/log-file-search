# Log-File-Search
Takes a moment to read the number of lines in a log file (or multiple log files) since I wasn't used to asynchronous tasks in VB at the time.

Added an asynchronous task when parsing the files for the keywords and added a progress bar based on the number of lines processed when the files were selected.
